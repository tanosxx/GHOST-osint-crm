## 🚀 Quick Start (Docker)

The easiest way to run GHOST is with Docker:

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone <repo-url>
cd GHOST-osint-crm

# Generate .env with secure random credentials
printf "DB_PASSWORD=$(openssl rand -base64 24)\nSESSION_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)\nDB_USER=postgres\nDB_NAME=osint_crm_db\nDB_HOST=db\nDB_PORT=5432\nNODE_ENV=development\nPORT=3001\nFRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8080\n" > .env

# Start all services
docker compose up --build -d
```

**Create your first admin user:**
```bash
# After containers are running
docker exec osint-crm-backend node scripts/createAdminSimple.js <username> <password> [email]

# Example:
docker exec osint-crm-backend node scripts/createAdminSimple.js admin MyStr0ngPass!
```

Password must be at least 12 characters. Common weak passwords are rejected.

## 🎮 Usage Guide

### Starting a New Investigation
1. **Create a case** in the Cases section
2. **Add people** with all relevant details
3. **Map connections** in Entity Network view
4. **Track locations** on the Global Map
5. **Import wireless networks** (if using WiGLE data)
6. **Assign tasks** to track investigation progress

### Wireless Network Intelligence
**Manual Entry:**
1. Go to Wireless Networks section
2. Click "Add Network" button
3. Enter network details (SSID required, rest optional)
4. Select associated people/businesses
5. Save and view on map

**KML Import:**
1. Export KML from WiGLE app/website
2. Go to Wireless Networks section
3. Click "Import KML"
4. Upload your KML file
5. Networks appear on map and table
6. Associate networks with people under investigation

**Map View:**
- Toggle wireless networks on/off in the global map
- Click WiFi icons for network details
- Filter networks by various criteria

### Entity Network Mapping
1. Navigate to "Entity Network" section
2. View interactive relationship diagram
3. Filter by entity types and relationships
4. Click nodes for details
5. Add connections between entities

## ⚡ Performance Notes

**Optimized for:**
- Up to 5,000 people records
- Up to 10,000 wireless networks
- Up to 1,000 locations on map
- Up to 500 relationship nodes

**Features:**
- Database-level geocoding cache
- Map marker clustering
- Pagination ready (future enhancement)
- Lazy loading support

## 🔐 Security Considerations

**Required in all environments:**
- ⚠️ **SESSION_SECRET** — mandatory, minimum 32 characters. App exits at startup if missing.
  ```bash
  openssl rand -base64 32
  ```
- ⚠️ **DB_PASSWORD** — no default. Must be set in `.env` before starting.
  ```bash
  openssl rand -base64 24
  ```

**Production hardening:**
- ⚠️ **Use strong DB_PASSWORD** — weak passwords (`changeme`, `password`, etc.) are rejected at startup
- 🔒 **PostgreSQL is not exposed to the host network** by default — only available within the Docker network
- 🔒 **Session cookies use `SameSite=Strict` and `HttpOnly`** — enable `secure: true` by setting `NODE_ENV=production`
- 🔒 **Never commit `.env` files** — contains sensitive credentials
- 🔒 **Use HTTPS in production** — configure a reverse proxy with SSL/TLS
- 🔒 **Keep `backend/public/uploads/` out of version control** — user-generated content
- 🔒 **Follow local laws for data collection** — comply with privacy regulations

## 🆘 Support & Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

### Issue: "Table 'users' does not exist"
This has been fixed in v2.1.0. The users table is now created automatically.
```bash
# Rebuild containers to apply fix
docker compose down -v
docker compose up --build
```

### Issue: Application won't start in production
Check that you've set required environment variables:
```bash
# Verify .env file contains:
DB_PASSWORD=<strong-password-not-changeme>
SESSION_SECRET=<32+-character-secret>
FRONTEND_URL=http://localhost:8080
```

### Issue: Permission denied errors in Docker
The backend now runs as non-root user (nodejs:1001). Ensure upload directories have correct permissions:
```bash
chmod -R 777 backend/public/uploads/
```

### General Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Check service health:**
   ```bash
   docker compose ps
   # All services should show (healthy)
   ```

2. **View logs:**
   ```bash
   docker compose logs backend
   docker compose logs frontend
   docker compose logs db
   ```

3. **Check health endpoint:**
   ```bash
   curl http://localhost:3001/api/health
   ```

4. **Verify database connection:**
   ```bash
   docker exec osint-crm-db psql -U postgres -d osint_crm_db -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users;"
   ```

5. **Clean restart:**
   ```bash
   docker compose down -v  # WARNING: Deletes all data
   docker compose up --build
   ```

6. **Check browser console** for frontend errors

7. **Open an issue on GitHub** with:
   - Error messages from logs
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Docker version
   - Operating system
